A simple passphrase generator.

Adjectives in English have a fairly strict ordering (quantity,
quality, size, age, shape, color, etc.), and the existing
generators didn't seem to pay attention to that. So I took the
medium sized wordlists from Dustin Kirkland's petname, sorted and
trimmed the adjective lists, pluralized all the nouns, and made a
generator that produces five-word passphrases, such as:

* four predictably outspoken elderly crayfish
* ample adoringly beautiful portly fowl
* eleven fabulously humble teenage spidermonkeys
* infinite ruthlessly gifted Rayon polecats
